# NIM Conference Presentation

This repository contains a conference presentation created from the academic paper "Network Identity Management: Application, Action and Device Aware Monitoring" using Marp (Markdown Presentation Ecosystem).

## Files Created

1. **`nim-presentation.md`** - Main presentation without speaker notes
   - 12 slides covering the key aspects of the research
   - Uses visual elements, emojis, and clear formatting
   - Suitable for projection during the conference

2. **`nim-presentation-with-notes.md`** - Presentation with detailed speaker notes
   - Same slides as above but includes comprehensive speaker notes
   - Notes provide context, examples, and talking points
   - Helpful for presenters to remember key details

3. **`compile-nim-presentation.sh`** - Compilation script
   - Generates PDF and HTML versions of both presentations
   - Uses the hahnec theme from marp-recipes-master

## Key Presentation Highlights

The presentation covers:
- **The Challenge**: Modern encrypted apps vs. security needs
- **NIM Solution**: Network-layer identity management without decryption
- **Technical Approach**: ML analysis of encrypted metadata
- **Results**: 98.6% accuracy in app identification, ~100% for devices
- **Real-world Applications**: Government, healthcare, finance use cases
- **Future Work**: Scaling and enhanced capabilities

## How to Use

### Viewing the Presentations
1. Open the `.md` files in any text editor to see the markdown source
2. Use Marp CLI or VS Code with Marp extension to preview

### Generating PDF/HTML Versions
```bash
# Make sure you have npm installed, then run:
./compile-nim-presentation.sh
```

This will generate:

- `nim-presentation-with-notes.pdf` and `.html`

### Presenting
- Use the PDF version for full-screen presentation
- HTML version works well for web sharing
- Speaker notes version helps during practice/preparation
